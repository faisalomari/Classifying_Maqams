We have created new dataset, with vatious of readers, which leads to more accurate results, and we really got good results as a start!
we've been understood really food the way we should deal with the model, how to get better results, its just a matter of time until we finish the project,
according to the supervisor Dr. Nimrod Peleg, the dataset we have is much better from the previous one, but still not big enough to get
the results and accuracy of 90%+ as in the article, we think that there is something hidden in the article, so we will continue without fully implementing it,
If we get accuracy of 70-80% then it is enough for the project because of the limits we have, and it still very good results indeed,
so if we get these results using the CNN model we've implemented, we won't continue to implement LSTM and ANN model because it won't affect the results
that much with this databse.
The plan for June is as following:
1- train the model on CNN and get the best results we can.
2- determine if we need to add another model or not (for now we won't)
In total, our job for this month is to finish the training process, and for the remaining time, is to add final touches and doing the article
and prepare for the presentation part and the article.
