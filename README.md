<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
<p>
  The main goal of this project is to build a robust and accurate system that can automatically classify and detect the maqam (a system of melodic modes used in Arabic music) of a given audio file. The system utilizes the power of deep learning algorithms to extract meaningful features from the audio signals, which are then used to predict the corresponding maqam class.
