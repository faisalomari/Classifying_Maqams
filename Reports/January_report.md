In January, we changed the plan according to the supervisor, we were asked to solve the assignments that were given with the CS231n course, there was a 3 assignments, the supervisor asked as to solve at least two so we can get familiar with the workspace and algorithms implementation, In summary, we did the first assignment, and started in the second one, but we didn't complete it because of the hard period of exams, the plan for now is to end at least the second assignment during the first half of February, and then to meet with the supervisor, and to set our next goals, we hope that before the end of february, we'll start our own project implementation, Accordingh to the supervisor that this part till now worth the time because getting familiar with the subjects we learned during the course gets a lot of time, but after that the work will be smoother and more effiecent.
