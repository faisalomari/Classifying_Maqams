- We have finished the article according to the notes we got from the supervisor (Nimrod) and according to the notes from the meeting (Ibrahim and Loay).
- We've also organized the code, and the github repository.
In addition to comminting the code lines in general.
- We've also uploaded the datasets (the two of them) into the following links:
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_b_699Maqam_dataset_b_/23837601
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/3869Maqam_dataset_zip/23837865

The next final step is to add the missing information to the article to get the final_report that will be submitted, as the described requirements, such as adding the unrelevant information that shouldn't be mentioned in the article.

THX!
