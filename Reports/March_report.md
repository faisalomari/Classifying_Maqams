In this  month, we didn't have a very big progress in the project, because there appeared that there is some material about deep learning and Maqamat and musical notes that we're missing of our knowledge, so we continued learning about such material so we'll start working while having full knowledge at least about things that we expect,
In April, the plan that we'll havbe 50% progress before the mid-term meeting on 16/4, we've already had about 90% knowledge aobout what we are going in, so that's a really big progress we've done, maybe because it's more scince project than just working (It's not a site building or such thing)
so we're now going to start formally in the Maqamat classifying module.
