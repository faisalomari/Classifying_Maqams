his month we have sat down with our mentor and told to make the classification like a competition for example: competition for file x:
Maqam 1 vs maqam 2: winner 1
Maqam 3 vs maqam 4:winner 4
Second round 
Maqam 1 vs maqam 4: winner maqam 4
And we got 69% accuracy after implementing this. 
our results: 
PAIR1:
-Ajam, ACCURACY = 28%
-Seka, ACCURACY = 37%
VALIDATION ACCURACY = 74%
TES ACCURACY = 33%

PAIR2:
-Nahawand, ACCURACY = 31%
-Bayat, ACCURACY = 87%
VALIDATION ACCURACY = 71%
TES ACCURACY = 56%

PAIR3:
-Hijaz, ACCURACY = 32%
-Saba, ACCURACY = 75%
VALIDATION ACCURACY = 85%
TES ACCURACY = 54%

PAIR4:
-Rast, ACCURACY = 37%
-Kurd, ACCURACY = 48%
VALIDATION ACCURACY = 89%
TES ACCURACY = 42%

second round:
PAIR1:
-Seka, ACCURACY = 0%
-Bayat, ACCURACY = 100%
VALIDATION ACCURACY = 79%
TES ACCURACY = 53%

PAIR2:
-Saba, ACCURACY = 88%
-Kurd, ACCURACY = 15%
VALIDATION ACCURACY = 82%
TES ACCURACY = 55%

last round:

final:
-Bayat, ACCURACY = 74%
-Saba, ACCURACY = 64%
VALIDATION ACCURACY = 73%
TES ACCURACY = 69%
WINNER ==> Bayat

for july we are planning to implement cnn with lstm so it can give us more accuracy according to the paper we have read
